## Create an interactive data analysis dashboard:

- Select an application domain and source dataset(s)
- Define a set of tasks to be accomplished using your dashboard
- Create a pen and pencil sketch of the dashboard
- Create a repository
- Implement the dashboard
- Submit a short dashboard description, sketches, github address, and a link to a live demo of the dashboard
  
## Expected elements:

- logo or monogram
- clean, elegant theme and/or custom CSS
- about and/or help section
- at least six interactive visualization components
- each visualization component should react to user input through a control widget
- at least one of the components should be a datatable
- at least one visualization component should offer a select interaction that triggers a change in another component (e.g. selecting a row in a movie datatable shows its review; clicking on a point on an actor scatter plot shows his/her headshot, brushing in a multiform view)
- tabs, pills, or multi-page view to separate different groups of components
- the dashboard should be dynamic (use a server)
## Other remarks:

- Start by thinking of a useful application. You can use a dataset your working on as part of another course this semester, create an app you would like to use, or come up with a fun project based on your interests
- Ideas for inspiration: Actor ranker, Movie reviewer, Flight tracker, Trip planner, Data clusterer, Stock market analyzer, Classification error analysis, Whiskey reviewer, Car price analyzer, Sport bet advisor, Pokedex, Social network analyzer, Covid tracker, Steam analysis, Spotify analysis, PubMed searcher, Housing/rental advisor
- Think of concrete applications and concrete datasets instead of general-purpose, dataset-agnostic apps
- When in doubt, ask the lecturer. Sketches and application ideas can be consulted freely.
- As in the previous assignments, this project can be done in pairs. Please state your partner in the comments, while submitting the assignment.
