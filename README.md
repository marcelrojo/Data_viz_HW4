## Eurovision Statistics - Interactive Dashboard
The assignment is to create an interactive dashboard depicting the phenomenom of our choosing. The dataset that we will use is the Eurovision dataset, which contains information reagrding the participants and locations of each Eurovision Song Contest from the years 1956-2024. 
Our interactive dashboard visualizes some of the most intriguing statistics from past Eurovision Song Contests.   If you're an Eurovision fan or simply love data and graphs, you've found the right place! 
The name EuroViz'on is a play on the words Eurovision and Visualization (Viz) â€“ the two things we love the most! The dashboard's theme is inspired by the vibrant and colorful theming of the ESC.
